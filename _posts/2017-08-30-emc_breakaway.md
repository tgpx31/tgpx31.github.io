Summertime--a time for relaxation and days at the beach. As a kid I always looked forward to staying home and doing nothing for days on end without any school. This summer was the last I'll have--I just started my senior year at Champlain.

Unlike the summer days of my childhood, I had the pleasure of staying in Vermont all summer long. I was working at the <a href="https://www.champlain.edu/centers-of-excellence/emergent-media-center">Emergent Media Center</a> (EMC) as the Advanced Programmer on the newest iteration of the BreakAway project.

For some context, the EMC undertakes projects that will have meaningful change in the world. It's an environment for students to get real world experience working in teams, all while influencing social progress. BreakAway is one of these projects.

BreakAway uses the Sabido methodology to teach a young audience how to treat others fairly and respectfully. You can play the original iteration <a href="http://www.breakawaygame.com">here</a>. After seeing much success in varying parts of the world such as El Salvador, BreakAway has been undergoing a mobile iteration. With the rise of mobile phones in society globally, it made for the perfect platform to extend the outreach of the project.

Looking back at the summer, I feel a real sense of accomplishment with the project. As a team we were able to develop a majority of the game's functionality and systems, as well as art and narrative.

On a personal level, I feel like BreakAway has helped me grow. It was the first project I had been on where I was given a preexisting product to work with. Building new systems felt akin to brickwork, each system strengthening the structure. Through the ups and downs, the EMC faculty and my coworkers provided helpful feedback on every aspect of the game. The game has (and still is) growing to be much more than that of the original.

Within the time span of only a few months, the amount of content grew exponentially. In the last week, we prepared a closing kit for the next team to inherit the project. I'm shifting my focus towards my last year of school, but I have full confidence that the final iteration of BreakAway will be awesome!
